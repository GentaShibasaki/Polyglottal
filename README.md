# Polyglottal Project

## Overview of this project

This project is to create sharing calendar by using Django! I created it following instructions on https://www.huiwenteo.com/normal/2018/07/24/django-calendar.html!
Also, I created authentication features for this app! You can see this application on the URL below.

## future features

- I'd like to make it look prettier! Because in terms of login/signup page are not pretty!
- I'd like to add Group feature! If you create or join Group, only group members are able to see plans among members!
- I'd like to add Notification feature! I think this app notify users their plans by e-mail or something!
- I'd like to add Image and Movie upload feature! To share your memory or show detailed image of your plan/event with your members!
